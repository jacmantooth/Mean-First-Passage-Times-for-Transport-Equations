Verification of Exit from a Circle Code

This repository contains the code developed for verifying the results presented in the paper. The purpose of this code is to demonstrate that all methods used agree within a 1% margin of error, providing confidence in the validity of the solutions.

Contents

The repository includes the following approaches for solving the problem:

Finite Element Method (FEM): Implementation of the numerical solution using FEM to approximate the solution.

Numerical Simulation: Direct simulation-based approach to solving the problem.

Analytical Solution: Derivation and computation of the exact analytical solution for comparison.
Results

All methods were verified to be within 1% of each other, validating the consistency and accuracy of the solutions.

This analysis focuses on a specific section of the paper, as noted in the accompanying documentation.

**new**
This section will now include using PINN(Physics Informed Neural Networks) on the MFPT for just escaping a circle 

Notes

Please keep in mind that this verification is limited to the section discussed in the paper.
For more details on the methodology and results, refer to the paper.
