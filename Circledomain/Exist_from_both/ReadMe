Verification of Section 6.1.4: Exit from the inner or outer circle of an annulus:

This repository contains files used to verify the results presented in Section 6.1.4 of our paper. Specifically, this case explores motion constrained to an annular region, where all trajectories satisfy
ρ<r<R 

The random  in the case where a particle can exit the annulus from both inner and outer circles r=ρ or r=R_0

Included Files

This repository contains the following files:

Python Script
A Python implementation demonstrating the solution and verifying its correctness.
A Finite Element Method (FEM) implementation that further validates the derived equation.
Purpose

Both implementations independently confirm the accuracy of our solution and demonstrate that the derived equation holds under the specified boundary conditions.

**Update**
Adding PINN solution
