Verification of Section 6.1.3: Exit from the outer circle of an annulus:

This repository contains files used to verify the results presented in Section 6.1.3 of our paper. Specifically, this case explores motion constrained to an annular region, where all trajectories satisfy
ρ<r<R 


The annular geometry highlights the effects of anisotropy, which can be more pronounced compared to motion within a disk. In this setup:

The random walker can only exit the annulus via the outer circle at 
r=R.
A Neumann boundary condition is imposed on the outer circle at r=rho

Included Files

This repository contains the following files:

Python Script
A Python implementation demonstrating the solution and verifying its correctness.
Finite Element Method File
A Finite Element Method (FEM) implementation that further validates the derived equation.
Purpose

Both implementations independently confirm the accuracy of our solution and demonstrate that the derived equation holds under the specified boundary conditions.
